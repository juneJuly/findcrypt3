findcrypt2 is an IDA Pro plug-in written by Ilfak Guilfanov that searches for
cryptographic constants used by many different algorithms in memory. x86/x64
processors can perform AES encryption/decryption without referencing the
constants by using AES-specific MMX instructions. This plug-in adds support for
finding MMX AES instructions in x86/x64 binaries.

findcrypt3 is an experiment to detect music codecs in x86/x64 binaries.
